netAQUA by Roslen is a sprinkler valve controller with a web interface.


I am running 16 valves watering 2 acres and spend quite a bit of time troubleshooting the breaks in lines, the electrical faults, and trying to keep the water bills optimized without killing all of the trees and plants.

The web interface for netAQUA is nice and the inventors are providing updates with the eventual release of an API.  In the meantime I wrote the script below to just scrape the data from the site and plan to do some simple graphs and reports using the R programming language because I happen to be taking courses in that language with Data Science as the subject matter.

This is the first draft with a fair bit of hard coded hacks that will need to be cleaned up and removed.  It's really more of a proof of concept.
